# Evolution and transcriptional regulation of inflorescence architecture development in rice

In rice, the structure of the mature inflorescence directly affects the amount of grain produced. Specification of inflorescence architecture occurs during the early stages of reproductive development under the control of genetic and environmental factors. In particular, the timing of transitions between meristem types is related to branching complexity. We have identified candidate genes and regulatory modules that may be involved in transcriptional control of this process using laser microdissection and RNA sequencing in the domesticated Asian rice accession, *Oryza sativa* ssp. *japonica* cv. Nipponbare. We are also working on a comparison of gene expression in wild and cultivated Asian and African rice varieties, to identify the mechanisms of molecular evolution responsible for the parallel increase of grain yield during domestication in both continents.
